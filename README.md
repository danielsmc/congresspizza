# CongressPizza
With [VideoPizza](https://github.com/rossgoodwin/videopizza) Technology

CongressPizza automatically summarizes hours of congressional proceedings into tasty slices of video. It uses the TextRank algorithm to identify the most salient passages from the closed captioning, and edits together a video of whatever length you'd like. All processing is handled by in-browser javascript-- there's no backend component. CongressPizza requires a modern browser and Flash. (Don't ask.)

Very much a work in progress.

## To Do:
* Handle videos multipart videos (>1hr)
* More robust summarization
* Styling
* Automatically find videos to summarize (rss feeds?)
* Code cleanup
